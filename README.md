# aws-ruby-examples
Unofficial code samples for AWS SDK for Ruby v2

These examples demonstrate the flow of the APIs for the different AWS services, and are not meant for production use.

    sudo pip install --upgrade awscli         # Install AWS CLI via Python PIP
    aws configure                             # Configure credentials and region
    aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --output text  # Test configuration

    bundle install

You'll need to edit the config.rb file

To load a file into IRB:

    irb -r ./<file>.rb
